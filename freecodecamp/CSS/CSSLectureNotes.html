                <li><h4>What Are the Basics Parts of a Computer?</h4>
                    <p>Discusses computer components. First the motherboard, which holds the memory and connectors to run the computer. Second the CPU(central processing unit) which is responsible for executing instructions and calculations.
                        Third is the RAM which is the short term memory AKA random access memory. RAM is volatile memory which means it will be lost when the computer is turned off. When you do save files it is stored on the hard drive. Hard drive are
                        made of spinning platter and an arm. Another key component is the power supply. This converts electricity to power the computer can use. The last is the expansion cards which includes sound card, video card, network card. 
                    </p></li>
                <li><h4>How Can You Effectively Work With Your Keyboard, Mouse, and Other Pointing Devices</h4>
                <p>Discusses proper use of peripherals. Talks about mouse grip needing to be relaxed and gentle. Next it talks about ergonomic keyboard + mouse to help with wrists. Talks about posture including sittingup straight and maintaining natural wrist position. Suggests using keyboard shortcuts as much as possible. </p></li>
                <li><h4>What Are the Different Tytpes of Internet Service Providers?</h4>
                <p>ISP or internet service providers come in 3 different tiers. First tier are conglomerate companies which handle their traffic independently. The second tier are country wide which rent access to tier 1 networks. The third tier are small companies 
                    that primarily focus on providing internet to local markets and rely on larger ISPS. Fibre optics rely on glass or plastic fibres to transmit data via light. Cable uses the infrastructure of a cable television. DSL use the infrastrucutre of a phone line. 
                    Dialup uses the phone line directly, and finally satellite uses satellites orbiting earth. Finally there are 5g and 4g which use cell tower infrastructure.
                </p></li>

                    <h4>What Are Safe WAys to Sign Into Your Computer?</h4>
                    <p>Make sure computer is password protected. Choose a password that is not easily hacked.2FA recommended. Windows hello is a good feature. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What Are Different Types of Tools Professional Developers Use?</h4>
                    <p>A computer is a primary development environment. Developers usually choose fast processing power and plenty of RAM. Integrated Development Environment is used for code editing on the computer. IDES include visual studio(vs code), intelliJ IDEA, jetbrains and pycharm.
                        Sublime text/atom/notepad++, brackets are some otehr code editors besides vs code. Version control is next and most people use Git. Package managers are another critical tool. They help developers by adding, updating, and removing libraries. Popular package managers are NPM, Yarn, PNPM for JavaScript.
                        PIP for python, composer for PHP Maven for java. Developers use frameworks to test such as cypress, playwright, selenium, and others. Jest for JS, pytest for python, Junit for Java, PHPUnit for PHP. Web browsers like chrome,firefox, edge, safari offer ways to inspect code.

                    <h4>How Can You Use File Management Applications on Your Computer?</h4>
                    <p>A file management application is a way to store, organize and edit files. In windows the default is file explorer, for mac its finder. You can organize files wiht tags and then search/click on colored tags. Smart folders is another ways because htey organized by filetype. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What Are Best Practices for Naming Files for Web Applications?</h4>
                    <p> Make the names of your files descriptive. Do not use spaces, use hyphens to separate words. Try to avoid using special characters and just letters and dashes. Some languages/workplaces have their own conventions follow those. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What Are Best Practices for File/Folder Organization in Web Applications?</h4>
                    <p>Presents a sample of how to organize files. Creating an assets folder where all images/fonts are stored and a css folder where the css pages are stored leaving the html files in the root. Also talks about having a README file wiht important details about the files. The readme file is in the MD extension for markdown which is used to write documentation. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>How Can You Create, Move, and Delete Files and Folders Using Explorer/Finder?</h4>
                    <p>You can create a file in File Explorer by clicking New in the top right. You can rename files by using the rename feature at the top. You can move files by dagging and dropping or cutting and pasting. To delete you click the trash bin or right click delete. For finder, you need to save files from the application of the file type you want. Cmd S lets you save a file. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>How Can You Search for Files and Folders on Your Computer?</h4>
                    <p> You can search for files from the taskbar or file explorer in windows. You can also search in file explorer and you can have many different depths of search. In mac you use spotlight using cmd spacebar. You can also search wihtin finder on Mac. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What Are Some Common File Types You Will Work With iin Web Applications?</h4>
                    <p>Html files end in .html. CSS files end in .css and JavaScript files end in .js. You will also need images which come in many types. JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group known for efficient compression. PNG - Portable Network Graphics preserves image quality but larger files. GIF - Graphics Interchange Format which supports animation and transparency. SVG - scalable vector graphics can be scaled without ever losing quality. 
                    Audio formats - MP3 efficient compression but lossy. MP4 good compression and supports audio/video codecs and metadata. MOV which is common in Apple quicktime products. WAV - lossless audio format, webM high quality open source video. There are also font formats. TTF - TrueType Font is compatible with different operation systems. WOFF - modern font format designed for web development. WOFF2 which has improved compression and performance.
                    You can also create archive files for muiltiple folders and files. The most widely used is ZIP. README.md contains information about how to use, install, how to contribute, and its license.

                <li>
                    <h4>What Are Some of the Common Web Browsers Available Today and How Do You Install One?</h4>
                    <p>Web browsers are application to view webpages on the internet. In 2024 the most popular are Edge, FireFox, Chrome, and Safari. Some browsers have unique features like Opera comes with a built in VPN. Brave focused on privacy and ad-blocking. You can install a browser through your operating systems package manager such as brew install --cask google-chrome with macOS Homebrew. You do not have to use one browser, many people use browsers for different purposes.[ </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What is the Difference Between a Web browser, a Website, and a Search Engine?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Web browsers are software applications that allow users to access and navigate the internet. Key features are address bar, rendering engine, bookmarks, extensions, privacy and security features. Popular ones are Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera. 
                        Websites are collections of web pages identified by a common domain and published to a web server. They are destinations visited on a browser. Components incldue the domain name, web pages, multimedia files, forms, buttons and can be static or dynamic.
                        Search engines are web based tools designed to find information. Search engines use web crawlers/spiders/bots that discover new content. They also use algorithms to determine the relevance and ranking of pages. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>How to Use a Search Engine Effectively to Achieve Optimal Results</h4>
                    <p>You can use boolean search syntax is a way to use special words to find exactly what you want. You can use quotations to find only the exact query. You can use + to find sites that include the words but not necessarily together. You can use the - to find things that do not have that term.
                        You can use site: to search within a specific website. Search operators can vary so look up the specific ones for the search engine you prefer.

                    <h4>What is CSS, and What Is Its Role on the Web?</h4>
                    <p>CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a markup language used to apply styles to HTML. The separation of sturcture and visual presentation has allowed developers to create more flexible maintainable websites.With CSS you can control the layout, colors, fonts and overall appearance without altering the HTML structure.
                        CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. One of the more powerful components of CSS is hte ability to create responsive designs. This allows web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. The cascading nature is also importnat because it allows styles to be inherited and overridden. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What is the Basic Anatomy of a CSS Rule?</h4>
                    <p>CSS is responsible for styles which are based on CSS rules. The rule is made of 2 main parts: a selector and a declaration block. selector { property:value; } Examples of selectors include type selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors. Curly braces {} are known as syntax for a declaration block. Inisde the declaration block is a series of declarations including property and value. Property is the css indetifier that specifies which feature is being styled.
                        An example of a property is background-color. After each property you should have a colon, and each value a semi colon. ID selectors are started with a # symbol. All class selectors must begin with a . . </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What is the Meta Viewport Element Used For?</h4>
                    <p> The meta viewport is crucial in responsive design. It's an element on how to control the pages dimensions and scaling on different devices. width=device-width tells the browser to set the width to the device. initial-scale=1.0 sets it to zoom 100% by default. You can turn off zooming wiht user-scalable=no but its not recommended. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What Are Some Default Browser Styles Applied to HTML?</h4>
                    <p>The default styles or user agent styles are the ones that come already implemented into HTML. These styles can vary slightly from one browser to another. For example H1 being bold and larger in comparison to the other headers.Another element with default style is the hr element which creates a way to separate content.
                        Blockquotes also have a default style of being indented and italicized. The anchor element is anotehr that is stylized by default by being blue and underlined. Lastly there are ul and ol.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What Are Inline, Internal, and External CSS, and When Should You Use Each One?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The three ways to apply CSS to HTML are inline, internal, and external. Each method has advantages and disadvantages and you should know when each is suitable. Inline is written directly into the HTML element use the style attribute. Inline CSS is used for quick one off styles or to override otehr styles for a specific element.It should be avoided typically becasue it can clutter HTML and make code harder to maintain.
                        Internal CSS is written with a style tag inside the head section of an HTML document. It applies styles to the entire page and is useful when you need to style a specific document. It does not promote reusability and makes the code harder to maintain in bigger projects. External css is written in a *.css document and is linked using the link element in the head section. It allows you to style many pages consistently and is the preferred method.
                        When linking it in the head people use the rel attribute to give it the value of style sheet, then href the css document. External CSS should be your go to approach to CSS implementation.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>How Do Width and Height Work?</h4>
                    <p>In CSS, the width and height properties are used to control dimensions of elements on the webpage. These properties can be defined in different units such as pixels (px) percentgages, viewport units vw,vh and more. You can use min-width and min-height to set a min width/height.
                        You can also use max-width and max-height for maximum width/height. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What Are the Different Types of CSS Combinators?</h4>
                    <p>Combinators are used to define the relationships between selectors in css. A descendant combinator is used to target elements matched by the second selector if they are nested within an ancestor element that matches the first selector. You can use this with just a space like figure img {} gets all imgs within figure.
                        Another combinator is the child combinator. This is used by the > and is used to slect elements that are the direct children of a specified parent element. Next sibling combinator + selects an element that immmediately follows a specified sibling element. You may use something like img + figcaption to select the fig caption for a style.
                        The subsequent sibling combinator ~ selects all siblings that follow the specified element. You could use h2 ~ p to select all paragraphs that follow an h2. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What is The Difference Between Inline and Block-Level Elements in CSS?</h4>
                    <p>In HTML and CSS there are inline and block level elements. Block level elements take up the full width available by default. Block level elements apply the display: block property by default. Some examples of these are div elements, paragraphs, headings, ordered lists, unordered lists, and sectione elements. Inline elements have the property display : inline enabled by default. Common inline elements are span, anchor, and img. Inline elements are used for styler small portions of text or emphasizing a word.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>How Does Inline-Block Work, and How Does It Differ from Inline and Block Elements?</h4>
                    <p>When working in CSS you often encounter 3 different types of display behaviors for elements: inline, block, and inline block. Each one effects how they are positions and interact with elements on the page. Block level elements are like large containers and take up the full width of the parent. They always start on a new line and their height and width can be adjusted. 
                        Inline elements only take up the space they need and do not break the line. The inline-block property is a hybrid of the two behaviors. It does not start a new line but you can adjust the height and width.  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What Are Margins and Padding, and How Do They Work?</h4>
                    <p>Margin and padding are essential properties in css. Margins control the space outside of an element, separating it from other element and defining the layout structure. Padding controls the space inside an element improving aesthetic and readability. Margins can do things like add space to the top of a paragraph using margin-top/bottom/left/right. You can also use just margin to apply all 4 or just use multiple numbers to do top right bottom left. Padding is basically the same just inside the area or section. </p>
                </li>

            <section id="specificity">
                <li>
                    <h4>What is CSS Specificity, and the Specificity for Inline, Internal, and External CSS?</h4>
                    <p>
                        CSS specificity is a fundamental concept that determines which CSS is applied when multiple could apply. It is based on the types of selectors used. Highest specificity is inline styles, ID selectors next like #main, class selectors, attribute selecotrs, pseudoclasses come into play next. Examples of class selectors are .container, attribute selectors like [type="text"], pseudoclasses like :hover.Specificity is calculated as a four part value (a,b,c,d). A is inline styles, B ID selectors, C is class selectors, attribute and pseudoclass. D is type, pseudoelement, and universal selectors.
                        Universal selecotrs are represented by * and they have the lowest specificity. Universal selectors are represented by * and they have the lowest specificity. A class selectors has a specificity of 0,0,1,0. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What is the Universal Selector, and What is Its Specificity?</h4>
                    <p>The universal selector * is a special that matches any element in the document. Ex for margin would be * {margin:0;} which would remove all margins from all elements. Setting margin and padding to 0 is a common practice in CSS resets. The universal selecotr has a specificity value of 0,0,0,0 which means its always overwritten. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What Is the Specificity for Type Selectors?</h4>
                    <p>Type selectors are also known as element selectors, they target elements based on tags. A type selector has a specificity of 0,0,0,1. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What is the Specificity for Class Selectors?</h4>
                    <p>Class selectors are key since they allow multiple elements within the same class to apply styles to. Class selectors are defined by . Class selectors have a higher specificity than type selectors, but lower than ID and inline styles (0,0,1,0). You can apply class selectors to other selectos to make more specific rules. 
                        For example p.highlight { } targets all highlight class paragraphs. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What is the Specificity for ID Selectors?</h4>
                    <p>ID selectors are selected with the # followed by the idname. They should be unique meaning no 2 elements should have the same ID name. The specificity is (0,1,0,0). </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What is the Important Keyword, and What Are the Best Practices for Using It?</h4>
                    <p>The !important keyword is used after the CSS value before the semicolon and it overrides all other styles. This bypasses specificity and overrides even inline styles. Its best to use !important sparingly since it can make maintenance and debugging more difficult.  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>How Does the Cascade Algorithm Work at a High Level?</h4>
                    <p>The cascade algorithm is the process the browser uses to decide which CSS rules apply when there are conflicts. The cascade algorithm considers relevance, origin and importance, specificity, scope, and order of appearance. Relevance means it checks for all selectors that actually apply to a given element.
                        Origin and importance means it checks the source between the browsers default, styles set by the user, and styles written by the author. Importance checks for things like !important. Next it checks specificity. Finally it checks the order of appearance with the last being executed.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>How Does Inheritance Work with CSS at a High Level?</h4>
                    <p>Inheritance is a key concept that determines how styles are passed own from parent elements to their children. Not all properties are inherited by default but properties like color, font, line height are inherited. Properties like margin, padding, border, and background are not inherited by default.
                        If you want a child element you need to set them or use the inherit keyword. You can use something like padding: inherit to make the padding transfer to the child. Inheritance only works from parent to child, not vise versa.

                    <h4>How Do You Space List Items Using margin or line-height?</h4>
                    <p>Margins and Line-height are essential for sapcing items to enhance readability and visual appeal. Margins can be used to create space between list items by apply margin to the li elements. This allows control over each list item. Another way to space out items is to use the line-height property.
                        This adjusts vertical spacing between lines within a single list item. To control individual items use the margin or padding properties.

                        In CSS the list-style property is used to control the appearance of list items. This works with both ul and ol. The list-style property is a shorthand for list-style-type, list-style-position, and list-style-image. The list-style-type allows you to change bullets or numbering systems. List-style-position can be used with inside or outside, outside being default. List-style-image lets you use an image as the bullet point which can be useful for providing your own unique style. Make sure the image is small and simple. You can use list-style with all 3 properties if you want.

                    <h4>Why are Default Link Styles Important for Usability on the Web?</h4>
                    <p>
                       Default link styles are important because they are what users expect. They provide clear visual cues that distinguish interactive elements. It is possible to edit links, but the principles should be maintained.

                    <h4>How Do You Style the Different Link States?</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are different states of a link including link, visited, hover, focus and active. Styling the link states is crucial for usability and accessibility. These provide immediate feedback on user interactions and are essential. You can style the states using psuedo-classes. The :hover pseudoclass is an example, or :visited. a:link { color:red;} is an example of changing unclicked links to red. :focus changes the style around it when navigating to it with the keyboard. :active when it is being clicked.

                    <h4>How Do Background Image Size, Repeat, Position, and Attachment Work?</h4>
                    <p>When working with background images you have several properties to control the display. The main ones are background-size, background-repeat, background-position, background-attachment. You can use background-size to set a size, you can use contain to make the image large without cropping or stretching. You can use background-size cover  so that the image will scale the entire element while maintaining the aspect ratio.
                        Background images repeat by default horizontally and vertical to fill the whole element. You can use background-repeat property to stop repeating with no-repeat. You can use repeat-x for horizontal repetition only within background-repeat property and y for vertical. Use background-position to change where the background image is. Finally background-attachment determines where the image scrolls or remains fixed with the main values being scroll and fixed.   </p>

                    <h4>What Is a Background Gradient, and How Does It Work?</h4>
                    <p>A background gradient is a smooth transition between two or more colors that can be applied to a background. There are 2 main types of gradients: linear and radial. Basic syntax: background: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...); The direction specifies the direction of the gradient and can be a word like right, bottom, side, corner, or an angle.
                        Color-stop specifics the positions where the gradient transitions occur. You can use vh or viewport height to specific when the gradient transitions. Radial gradients radiate from an origin usually the center outword in a circular or elliptical shape. Syntax: background: radial-gradient(shape size at position, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...); The shape specifies circle or ellipse, size determines the ending shape. The closest-side keyword makes the gradients ending shape fit the closest side of the element. Gradients can enhance designs  without needing images.

                    <h4>What Are Some Accessibility Considerations for Backgrounds?</h4>
                    <p>One of the primary concerns when choosing backgrounds is ensuring sufficient contrast between background and text for readability. WCAG recommends a min. contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal and 3:1 for large text. Also avoid putting text over busy or complex backgrounds, such as images or gradients with multiple colors. If you are using a background image it is recommended to use a semi-transparent overlay.
                        Also when designing background avoid using colors as the sole means of conveying information. You should use symbols or text to convey the information. If you want to have background audio always have a way to mute or pause the audio.

                    <h4>What Are the Different Ways You Can Add Borders Around Images? </h4>
                    <p>In css there are several ways to get borders around images. You can use the border property This property is shorthand that allows you to set the width, style, and color of the border all at once. For example img {border: 2px solid red;} will add a 2 pixel wide solid red border around all iamges. You can adjust solid to dashed dotted or double to suit your design needs.
                        If you need more control over the sides you can use specific properties for each side. Such as  border-top: 1px dashed green; This allows you to create unique borders for each side. You can also use the outline property which is similar but doesnt affect the elements dimensions or layout. You can use border-radius to make rounded corners for your border. You can combine and customize these options to fit your needs.</p>
