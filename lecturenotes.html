                <p>In this section we learn about the link element ( &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" /&gt; ) and many various attributes for it such as rel and href. We learn that functionally it links to external resources like stylesheets and site icons. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h5>What is an HTML Boilerplate, and Why Is It Important?</h5>
                <p>In this section we learn about the ready made template called a boilerplate. It stresses the important of meta commands doctype and basic html structure that you can use as a foundation for all your websites and pages</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <p>In this section we learn about the command &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt; and how it is important for making sure all characters from all writing systems are included in your page.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>What are Div Elements and When Should You Use Them?</h5>
                    <p>In this section we look at a couple different elements used to group elements. The first one that is learned about is the &lt;div&gt; element that you can use to group things together without having a semantic meaning. They compare it to the &lt;section&gt; element which can be used to add in semantic meaning.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>What are IDs and Classes, and When Should You Use Them? </h5>
                    <p>This section talks about the id attribute. It talks about how it can be used to reference CSS things and how it should not contain spaces and needs to be unique. It then moves on to contrast that with the class attribute which doesn't need to be unique.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>What Are HTML Entities, and What Are Some Common Examples?</h5>
                    <p>In this section it describes entities which can be used to display characters that are reserved by html. This usually starts with & and ends with ;. You can surround lt and gt with those symbols to get HTML element looking text. You can also use these to make copyright/trademark symbols.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What is the Role of the Script Element in HTML, and How Can It Be Used to Link to External JavaScript Files?</h4>
                    <p>In this section they talk a bit about the script element, discuss how you can put a javascript alert in the path, but best practice is to include a .js file that you put all your javascript code in.</p>
