  <h1>Confidential Email</h1>
<main id="email">
  
  <p>Dear <span class="blurred">Agent Flip,<div id="confidential"> <h2>CONFIDENTIAL</h2></div></span></p><p>
We have an emergency. The secret recipe for our <span class="blurred">Titan Patty</span> has been compromised. This recipe is what makes our burgers the juiciest, most savory, and unmistakably unforgettable.
  </p>
  <p>
    We suspect that <span class="blurred">Professor Sear </span>is behind this. He has taken the recipe to his hidden test kitchen. Your mission is to infiltrate the kitchen and secure the recipe before it's sold, spilled, or served to the public.
    </p>  <div id="top-secret"><h2>TOP SECRET</h2></div>
    <p>Be sure to keep the kitchen's location confidential. Any leak of this information could jeopardize the entire operation.

â€” <span class="blurred">Control Kitchen</span></p>
