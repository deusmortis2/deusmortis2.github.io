            <h4>Course Structure and Projects</h4>
            <p>
              This section gives a brief overview of the topics that will be
              taught and the structure of the course.

            <h4>Watch Before You Start!</h4>
            <p>
              This video kind of goes through what the target audience is and a
              bit of caution about ratings

            <h4>Setting Up Our Code Editor</h4>
            <p>
              This section reviews getting VS code and a couple other
              alternatives. It primarily focuses on VS code and a few important
              settings that the instructor wants you to use.

        <li><h3>Section 2: JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1</h3></li>
        <li><h4>Hello World!</h4>
        <p>In this section we use the dev tools inside of a google chrome browser to write some code. We use alerts to display hello world, and define a single variable that we eventually display using an if statement.</p></li>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>A Brief Introduction to JavaScript</h4>
            <p>
                JavaScript defined as a high level, object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language. 3 languages for web dev: html for content, css for presentation, and JS is the programming language(web apps). Talks about effects potentially used by
                twitter through JavaScript. Talks about common front end libraries like React, Angular, and Vue and how it is important to learn JS first. Talks about how JS can be used for back end apps, mobile apps, and even native desktop applications. Finally,
                finished with talking about updates from ES(ECMAScript) 5 to ES6(2015), ES7-ES11(2020).  
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Linking a JavaScript File</h4>
            <p>Talks about how to download starter and end files for the course. Then used the script inline method, followed by writing a script for the starter course for fundamentals of javascript. Talks about using console.log(); </p>
        </li>    
        <li>
            <h4>Values and Variables</h4>
            <p>
                Value is the smallest amount of information in JavaScript. Variable is a container for values. Then declared a variable with let. After declaring, we can use the variable by its name. Variables are easy to change a value and it happens throughout the code.
                Variables are usually named in camelCase. Errors will show up in the console without console.log. Hard rules: 1. cannot start with a number; 2. can only contain numbers,letters, underscores, $ ;3. Cannot use reserved words (new/function). Real constants in uppercase.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Data Types</h4>
            <p>
                Every value is either an object or primitive value. Primitive types - Number - decimals/integers, String - sequence of "char",Boolean - true/false, Undefined - default variable value, Null - empty value, Symbol(ES2015) - value that is unique, BigInt(ES2020) - larger integers. Javascript has dynamic typing, data types are determined automatically. 
                In VS code you can use ctrl + slash to create a comment. Learned typeof operator to check data types. Undefined can be both a value and a type. Null is a data type and a value, but null still displays as a type object even though this is an unfixed bug. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>let, const, and var</h4>
            <p>
                When you change a variable value it is called assigning or reassigning, you can also refer to it as mutating the variable. When you use const to define a variable, it is immutable or it cannot be changed without creating an error. You can change the value of a var variable like let. Let is block scoped, and var is function scoped. You should basically never use var.
                You can also use variables without any declaration. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Basic Operators</h4>
            <p>
            Operators allow us to transform values. Mathematical, comparison, logical, assignment.. are just some types of operators. This lesson starts with mathematical or arithmetic operators. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Operator Precedence</h4>
            <p>
                Operator precedence determines how operators are parsed in relation to each other. Talked about MDN operator precedence resource which has a full list of priority. Talks about the precedence numbers in the table.
                Most operators especially math are left to right. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Challenge 1: Video Solution</h4>
            <p>
                This is the demonstration solution for the first challenge. One of the major differences between his code and mine is that he used const for all his variables. However, he did not display both tests in the same code base which required let variables.
                He also used a single console log for both variables with less text in the log. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Strings and Template Literals</h4>
            <p>
                In this section we learned about template literal strings and string concocatenation. We compared the nuances of the two when writing a variable heavy sentence. Template literals are created by `` and the variables are declared in ${}. 
                Also talks about multi line strings with each in comparison. Also \n for regular strings new line, but template literals you can just use enter. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Taking Decisions: if / else Statements</h4>
            <p>
                Learned about if statements, if (condition) {} and the else {} statement. This will execute code depending on whether the condition is true or false. Also talked a bit about scope and the when you can access variables from inside a code block. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Challenge #2 Solution</h4>
            <p>This challenge was short in code lines. So outside of the fact that I just skipped straight to the second way to display, the only difference is that he did both ways to display. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Type Conversion and Coercion</h4>
            <p>
                Type conversion is when we manually convert from one type to another. Type coercion is when JS automatically changes the type. NaN is when an operation fails to give us a new number, but it is a number type and its more like an invalid number.
                Type coercion happens mostly when trying to compare values of different types. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Truthy and Falsy Values</h4>
            <p>
                Falsy values are values converted to false when evaluated in a boolean context. Falsy values: 0, '', undefined, null, NaN. Truthy values are basically anything else. Boolean coercion is usuaully implicit and not explicity although you can use 
                Boolean().
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Equality Operators: == vs ===</h4>
            <p>
                You do not need {} for an if statement if there is only one line of code. = is an assignment operator, == and === are equality operators. === is a strict equality operator, and does not perform type coercion. == does perform type coercion. As a general 
                rule use the strict equality(===) over the loose ==. If you need to do type coercion its usually better to use explicit. You can add extra ifs to a single if statement with else if. There is also not != loose, !== strict. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Boolean Logic</h4>
            <p>
                Using the && AND operator you can combine statements. You can also use the || OR operator to combine statements too.  You can use a 3x3 truth table, to see values with A and B OR or and topleft, true/false and then the outcomes. Consider Age = 16. A. Age is greater or equal 20 (false)
                B Age is less than 30 (true). !A = true,  A AND B false, A OR B true. !A and B, true. A or !B = false. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Logical Operators</h4>
            <p>
                Applying logical operators from last lesson into javascript. Comparing strict and loose equalities.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Challenge 3: Solution</h4>
            <p>
                Get average results then display winner for Challenge 3: Gymnastics Results. Mostly the same as my solution with a couple extra emojis and a print of the initial averages before the comparison results. Also he used if, with 2 else ifs.
                I used 1 if, else if, and else. Missed the bonus challenges, had to pause and go back and input them. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>The switch Statement</h4>
            <p>
                Talked about the switch statement which starts with switch (variable) { case 'something': code; break;}. If you do not code break statements it continues to execute cases. Compares switch to an if else statement.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Statements and Expression</h4>
            <p> 
                Expressions is a piece of code that produces a value. Ex. 3+4 is an expression. A truth comparison is an expression. A statement is a bigger peice of code that is execute and which does not always produce a value on its own. 
                A declaration is like a complete sentence, and if then are statements. However, they can have strings and conditionals that produce values so they would be expressions. Statements end in a ;.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>The Conditional (Ternary) Operator</h4>
            <p>
                In this one we give a condition ? result if true : result if false;. This is an operator since it produces a value, and also makes it an expression. Usually ternary is used to store variables conditionally. 
                Compared the ternary object for declaring a variable to an if then statement to declare a conditional variable. You can use a ternary statement during a template literal. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Challenge #4: Video Solution</h4>
            <p>
                In this case the challenge solution was exactly the same as mine, except I chose to create bill2/bill3 so I could display all 3 tests on a single page. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>JavaScript Releases: ES5, ES6+ and ESNext</h4>
            <p>
                Start with a brief history of JavaScript. 1995 - Brendan Eich creates the first JavaScript in 10 days it was called mocha. 1996 - Mocha changes to LiveScript and then to JavaScript, in order to attact Java developers. 1996 - Microsoft launches IE copying JavaScript from Netscape and called it JScript. 
                1997 - ECMA releases ECMAScript (ES1) the first official standard for JavaScript. 2009 - ES5 (ECMAScript 5) released with lots of great new features. 2015 - ES6 was released, the biggest update to a language ever. In 2015 ECMA script changes to an annual release cycle. All versions of JavaScript needs to be 
                backwards compatible. Old features are never removed, so really new versions are more like releases than versions. No forwards compatability. During development is to use latest google Chrome. During production, Use Babel to transpile and polyfill your code. ES5 is ready to be used today for all browsers. 
                ES6 is supported in all modern browsers, but not in older browsers. Can use most features with transpiling and polyfilling. ESNext - future versions of the language. This is because the features have to go through 4 stages before they are fully released. It's important to learn old javaScripts because they are stil used.

            <h4>Activating Strict Mode</h4>
            <p>
                Talks about turning on strict mode in javascript. To do this you have to 'use strict'; as the first line of code. This will help with errors and bugs in our programs. It forbids us to do some things, and creates visible errors in the code to debug. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Functions</h4>
            <p>
                Functions are blocks of code that we can reuse repeatedly, its like a variable for blocks of code instead of just values. To use a function, we use a process called invoking, running, calling the function. A function can take in data, and it can return data 
                as well. You take in parameters, and return something back to the call. Functions let you have reusable blocks of code most importantly.
            </p>
