                <h3>Probability</h3>
                <p>In this unit we will explore simple probability and its complement. We will explore both experimental and theoretical probability and their differences. We will also explore how to calculate probabilities in various scenarios depending on their characteristics. We will begin this unit in December of 2025</p>

                <h3>Geometry</h3>
                <p>In this unit we will explore topics such as area, surface area, and volume. We will learn various formulas to calculate all of them and the relationships between them that create those formulas. We will begin this unit in January of 2026</p>

                <h3>Rational Number Operations</h3>
            <p>In this unit we explored Rational number sets including integers, whole, and natural numbers. We explored integer operations of addition,subtraction, multiplication and division. We also explored fractions wiht all operations. WE ended this unit at the end of August in 2025.</p>

                <h3>Equations and Inequalities</h3>
            <p>In this unit we explored variables and expressions including combining like terms. We also explored how to solve equations with inverse operations up to 2 step equations. Following this we have been exploring inequalities up to 2 step inequality equations. We will end this unit at the beginning of october 2025.</p>
