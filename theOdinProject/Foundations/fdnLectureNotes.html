The work for clients is usually project focused and involves collaborating with a team to coordinate the client's needs into the end product. The work could involve lots of requirements from front/backend/fullstack. Front end is the things
                      you see on your browser when you visit the website. Back end is things that live on the servers that stores and serves data to the front end. Fullstack developers work with both. Types of careers: large tech companies often have strict requirements, Startups often have lower salaries and longer
                      hours. Freelancer you design products for people, or a consultant for a web consultancy.Large older companies still need web developers. Tools: computer, google, text editor, command line interface, stack overflow, git, github.
