      <h2>Here's a timeline of Leonardo Di Vinci</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
<span class="date">1452</span> - Born on April 15 in Vinci, Italy, the illegitimate son of a notary, Ser Piero, and a peasant woman, Caterina.
        <li>
<span class="date">1466</span> - At age 14, becomes an apprentice to Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence, where he learns painting, sculpting, and technical-mechanical arts.</li>
<li>
<span class="date">1472</span> - Accepted into the painters' guild of Florence, yet continues working under Verrocchio. Legend says Verrocchio stopped painting after seeing Leonardo's angel in The Baptism of Christ, believing his pupil had surpassed him.</li>
<li>
<span class="date">1482</span> - Moves to Milan to work for Duke Ludovico Sforza. In a famous letter, Leonardo offers his services as a military engineer, describing designs for tanks, bridges, and weapons.</li>
<li>
<span class="date">1485-1490</span> - Paints The Last Supper and conducts extensive anatomical studies, dissecting human bodies to better understand muscles, bones, and organs.<br></li>
<li>

<li>

<li>
<span class="date">1508-1513</span> - Works in Milan again, studying hydraulics and anatomy. His notebooks overflow with sketches of human organs, plant studies, and mechanical devices—centuries ahead of their time.</li>
<li>
<span class="date">1513-1516</span> - Moves to Rome under the patronage of Giuliano de' Medici, where he studies optics, geology, and mechanics. Despite limited commissions, his scientific curiosity flourishes.</li>

      “Leonardo's life and work remind us that art and science are not separate disciplines, but two sides of the same human quest—to understand and shape the world.”
