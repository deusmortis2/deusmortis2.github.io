  <h4>Using Google, StackOverflow and MDN</h4>
  <p>
    This talks about how to use stack overflow first to find examples and learn
    from them to get syntax. Also explores MDN libraries for learning. MDN will
    have information about the desired element and related methods. The video
    uses mdn to get an example of how to use array concat method.
