                    <p>Document Structure Roles - define structure of a webpage. Specify roles that dont have semantic elements such as toolbar, tooltip, feed, math, presentation, note. Widget roles are scrollbar, searchbox, separator, slider, spinbutton, switch, tab, tabpanel,treeitem. Landmarks classify and label primary sections ex. banner, complementary, contentinfo, form, main, navigation, region, search. Live Regions define elements that change dynamically including alert, log, maruqee, status, timer. Window Roles - alertdialog and dialog it is considered best practice to use dialog and the JavaScript methods. Abstract roles help organize a document.  </p>

Dangers of labeledby over label - sometimes its not translated. It can provide a mismatch between the label text and the invisible label. It can create complex invisible labels. Never use both together.</p>
