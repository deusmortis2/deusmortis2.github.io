      <h2>Carnival Games</h2>
      <p>Get ready for a fang-tastic time at our Halloween Festival! Students can join in a variety of spooky (but not too scary!) games to win tickets and prizes. Toss rings onto witchesâ€™ hats, race through the pumpkin relay, or try your luck at the ghostly bean bag toss! Brave souls can test their aim in the mummy wrap challenge or fish for creepy-crawly treasures in the cauldron pond. Every game earns tickets that can be traded in for sweet treats and fun prizesâ€”so grab your costume, bring your best Halloween spirit, and get ready for a night full of laughter, thrills, and friendly competition!</p>
